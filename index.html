        Mr Jones's shop sold food. Mr Jones and a young man worked there. The young man's name was
        George. A man came into the shop on Monday. He was a funny man. Mr Jones was in the office. It was
        behind the shop. The funny man looked at George and said, "I want a small table, please." George said,
        "We don't sell tables in this shop. We sell food." The man smiled and answered, "A small, brown table."
        He took a picture out of his bag and showed it to George. It was a picture of a small, brown table.
        George put his mouth near the man's ear and said, "We do not have tables in this shop! Food! Not
        tables!" The man smiled and answered, "That's good. Thank you." Then he sat down on a chair and
        waited. George was not happy. He went into the office and spoke to Mr Jones. Then he and Mr Jones
        came out again. Mr Jones was angry. He looked at the man and said, "What do you want?" The man
        smiled and answered, "I want a loaf of brown bread, please. Haven't you got any bread in your shop?"
        Mr Jones said, "Yes, we have." He looked at George, and then he went and got a loaf of brown bread
        from a big box and gave it to the man.

        Gladys was at school in a small, quiet town in England. She was sixteen years old, and her father and
        mother were poor, and their house was very small. Maisie was Gladys's friend. She went to that school
        as well. Gladys said, "Maisie, I'm going to find a very rich man and I'm going to marry him. Then I'm
        going to have a beautiful house and a large garden, and a lot of clothes, and a lot of money." Maisie
        smiled and said, "Where are you going to find a very rich man, Gladys? There aren't any in our town."
        But Gladys was a very pretty girl. Her eyes were blue, and her hair was black and soft. She went to
        London, and then she went to America. She found a tall, very rich man there, and she married him. She
        was twenty-two years old then. Then she and her husband went to England. They went to Gladys's old
        house, and Maisie came there. Gladys said, "I've married a very rich man, Maisie, and I've got a beautiful
        house and a large garden and four gardeners. And I've bought a lot of clothes and I have money as well.
        My husband's got a plane too, and he flies it!" Maisie said, "A lot of people have got planes and fly them,
        Gladys." "In their house?" Gladys asked.

        Alan Smith's father bought him a small shop, and Alan sold milk, butter, cheese, eggs and other tilings in
        it. His shop was in a small town, and it was open on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and
        Saturday, and on Sunday morning, but it was shut on Sunday afternoon and on Monday. Alan went to
        some farms on Monday and bought their best butter and cheese and eggs from the farmers, but he
        bought his milk in the town. A truck brought it to his shop in the morning. Alan and his wife worked in
        the shop, and they sold a lot of their food, because it was good and clean. A fat woman came into the
        shop on Saturday. She bought some eggs and some butter, and then she said to Alan's wife, "Your eggs
        and your butter are dear today. Why are Saturday and Sunday dearer than Tuesday, Wednesday,
        Thursday and Friday?" Alan's wife was unhappy. She looked at the fat woman, and then she looked at
        Alan, but she did not give an answer. Then Alan smiled and said, "Our food is not dearer on Saturday
        and Sunday! It is cheaper on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday!"

        Mr and Mrs Brown had two daughters and two sons. Both the daughters married, and then both the
        sons married too. Soon Mr and Mrs Brown had a granddaughter, and then they had two grandsons.
        They were very happy. Then one of their daughters had another baby, and she telephoned her mother,
        "Please come and help with your new granddaughter." Mrs Brown went quickly, but Mr Brown stayed at
        home, because he was nearer his job there. But he said, "I'll come on Friday evening, and I'll stay till
        Monday morning." On Friday evening, after work, Mr Brown got into a train. He was very happy. "I'm
        going to see my new granddaughter now," he said. There were three empty places in the train. There
        was an old man beside one empty place, and Mr Brown went to him and said nicely, "Are you a
        grandfather?" "Yes," the man answered, "I have three granddaughters." Mr Brown went to the second
        empty place. There was a nice woman beside that. Mr Brown said to her, "Are you a grandmother?" The
        woman answered, "Yes, I have two granddaughters and two grandsons." Mr Brown went to the third
        empty place. There was a man beside that, and Mr Brown said to him, "And are you a grandfather?"
        "No, I'm not," the man answered. Mr Brown smiled happily and said, "That's good." He sat down in the
        empty place and said to the man kindly, "Now I'll tell you about my granddaughters and grandsons."

        Joe was the son of a farmer. His father's farm was poor, and Joe worked on it for a long time, but then
        his father died, and Joe said, "I needn't stay here now. I'll sell this farm and buy one in a better place.
        Then I'll soon be rich." He bought a farm in the east of the country, but then Ms new neighbours said to
        him, "The weather's often very bad here. The wind's very strong, and it breaks windows and doors. You
        must build a room under the ground, and then you and your family can go down there, and you'll be
        safe from the wind." So Joe built a room under the ground. It was a lot of work, because the ground was
        hard. But after that, the weather was good for a very long time. There was no wind, and Joe spoke
        angrily. He said, "Why did I listen to my neighbours? I didn't have to make that room under the ground.
        The wind never blows strongly here." But then one day there was a very strong wind, and Joe and his
        family had to go down into their room under the ground. They were there for a long time. Then the
        wind stopped, and they came up. All the windows and doors in their house were broken. Joe was not
        angry about his work now. He smiled happily and said, "Ah! I'm glad I built that room!"
